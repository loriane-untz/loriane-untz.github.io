        <h3>Poster Design &#8211; 2023</h3>
        <p>
            In my junior year of highschool, I took an online class in digital media that taught students how
            to work with various softwares such as Adobe Phtotoshop and Animate. One of our key assignements
            was to create an advertisment poster for the course.
            <br>
            <br>
            The poster I had designed was chosen to become the next year's "banner" that would represent
            the course on the school website.
